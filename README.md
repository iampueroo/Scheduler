Scheduler
=========

What it will be
----------------
Think WhenIsGood, but instead of letting you know WHEN people can work, it'll create a schedule with the given times.

Backstory
---------
Basically this is my excuse to learn python and interval trees. Here's the situation: you're in charge of a schedule for a bunch of people. You send them a link where they fill out when their free. (Right now it's very dangerously simlar to WhenIsGood).
Now INSTEAD of merely telling you WHEN people can work, it CREATES the schedule(s) for you, based on parameters given, such as
  - how many hours each employee should work
  - Fair scheduling
  - shift intervals (shifts of one hour / half hours / etc).
  
  
Obviously in progress. Cheers.
